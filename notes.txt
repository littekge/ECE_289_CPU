Memory:

Uses 32-bit words of 4 bytes each
memory is circular, so the max address is adjacent to address zero

the fetch stage is an implicit read
lw and sw are explicit memory accesses

the execution environment determines where in the memory implicit and explicit accesses are allowed. These areas can overlap
An implicit access that has no exceptions or side effects can occur arbitrarily early, meaning that in theory the whole instruction memory can be read before a single line is executed.

See chapter 17 for a memory consistancy model


Instruction Length Encoding:

instructions are 32 bit and word aligned
IALIGN refers to the standard 32 bit instruction size
ILEN is max instruction length (32 for base riscv)

32 bit instructions have their lowest two bits set to 11
encoding with [15:0] = 0 is illegal
encoding with [ILEN-1:0] = 1 is illegal

instructions are little-endian (MSB is the rightmost bit)
