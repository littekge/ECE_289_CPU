changelog:
	1. Added basic FSM states, created memory (4/20/25)
	2. Started work on debugging modules, implemented FSM to start writing registers to ascii master buffer. (4/23/2025)
	3. continued work on debug module. Multiple FSM revamps (4/24/25)
	4. finished debug module FSM, awaiting testing (4/24/25)
	5. finished debug module (4/26/25)

todo:
	1. simplify and revamp ascii controller (remove double buffer) to save on RAM and processing power. (IF TIME ALLOWS)
	2. make debug display output more functional (add labels to registers, add current instruction display, etc.) (IF TIME ALLOWS)
	3. add debug toggle switch that allows use of one button for single cycle or another button for single instruction.
	4. recreate memory to use 32 bit words instead of 8 bit.
	5. implement fetch stage of processing.
	

testing needed:
	1. test that state transitions and delay works properly
