changelog:
	1. Added basic FSM states, created memory (4/20/25)
	2. Started work on debugging modules, implemented FSM to start writing registers to ascii master buffer. (4/23/2025)

todo:
	1. finish FSM for debug module
	2. add decoding to determine the current register based on vertical state of debug module
	3. add decoding to determine the current address of the master buffer to be written to based on both horizontal and vertical states

testing needed:
	1. test that state transitions and delay works properly
	2. test debug functionality
