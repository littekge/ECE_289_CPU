changelog:
	1. Added basic FSM states, created memory (4/20/25)
	2. Started work on debugging modules, implemented FSM to start writing registers to ascii master buffer. (4/23/2025)
	3. continued work on debug module. Multiple FSM revamps (4/24/25)
	4. finished debug module FSM, awaiting testing (4/24/25)
	5. finished debug module (4/26/25)
	6. added byte enable to memory, started work on decoding, implemented fetch step (4/30/25)
	7. worked on register-immediate instruction decoding (5/1/25)
	8. worked on register-immediate instruction decoding, created and worked on alu module (5/5/25)
	9. implemented register-register instruction decoding (5/6/25)
	10. implemented register-immediate instruction decoding (5/6/25)
	11. turned registers into array, implemented jal instruction (5/7/25)
	12. debugging for 3 hours (5/7/25)
	13. implemented memory controller module (5/8/25)

todo:
	1. make debug display output more functional (add labels to registers, add current instruction display, etc.) (IF TIME ALLOWS)
	2. add debug toggle switch that allows use of one button for single cycle or another button for single instruction.
	3. implement decoding
		a. continue to implement alu
		b. implement jalr instruction
	4. implement error framework
	

testing needed:
	1. test currently implemented instructions (reg-reg and jal)
