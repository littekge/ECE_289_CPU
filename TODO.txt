changelog:
	1. Added basic FSM states, created memory (4/20/25)
	2. Started work on debugging modules, implemented FSM to start writing registers to ascii master buffer. (4/23/2025)
	3. continued work on debug module. Multiple FSM revamps (4/24/25)
	4. finished debug module FSM, awaiting testing (4/24/25)

todo:
	1. simplify and revamp ascii controller (remove double buffer) to save on RAM and processing power. (IF TIME ALLOWS)
	2. add debug toggle switch that allows use of one button for single cycle or another button for single instruction.
	3. decide how memory works (8 bit vs 32 bit, if using 8 bit, one memory vs four memories)
	4. make debug display output more functional (add labels to registers, add current instruction display, etc.) (IF TIME ALLOWS)

testing needed:
	1. test that state transitions and delay works properly
	2. test debug FSM
