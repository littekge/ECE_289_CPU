changelog:
	1. Added basic FSM states, created memory (4/20/25)
	2. Started work on debugging modules, implemented FSM to start writing registers to ascii master buffer. (4/23/2025)
	3. continued work on debug module. (4/23/25)
	4. continued work on debug module. Multiple FSM revamps (4/24/25)
todo:
	1. finish revamping fsm for debug module
	2. simplify ascii controller (remove double buffer) to save on RAM and processing power. (IF TIME ALLOWS)

testing needed:
	1. test that state transitions and delay works properly
	2. test debug functionality
