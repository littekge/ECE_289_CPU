changelog:
	1. Added basic FSM states, created memory (4/20/25)
	2. Started work on debugging modules, implemented FSM to start writing registers to ascii master buffer. (4/23/2025)
	3. continued work on debug module. Multiple FSM revamps (4/24/25)
	4. finished debug module FSM, awaiting testing (4/24/25)
	5. finished debug module (4/26/25)
	6. added byte enable to memory, started work on decoding, implemented fetch step (4/30/25)
	7. worked on register immediate instruction decoding (5/1/2025)

todo:
	1. simplify and revamp ascii controller (remove double buffer) to save on RAM and processing power. (IF TIME ALLOWS)
	2. make debug display output more functional (add labels to registers, add current instruction display, etc.) (IF TIME ALLOWS)
	3. add debug toggle switch that allows use of one button for single cycle or another button for single instruction.
	4. implement decoding
		a. implement integer register immediate instruction decoding
	

testing needed:
	1. test that state transitions and delay works properly
	2. test that fetch works
